plot(train$Age, train$Fare, 
     main="Correlation between Age of Passengers and Fares", 
     ylab= "Fare Amount", 
     xlab = "Age of Passenger")
cor(train$Age, train$Fare)
[1] -0.09242386

The two variables do not seem related because there isn't a clear linear association between both. Most of the fare amounts are under 100 but they're dispersed throughout
all the ages from 0 to 80. This makes sense because of correlation is -0.09242386 showing there isn't a strong linear association between age and fare.
